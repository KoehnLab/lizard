- Finding tensor factorization follows the general concept of "strength reduction" (see [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_reduction))

- In general we should investigate common optimizations performed by compilers. Some (many) of those could be applicable to tensor expressions as well
- Make sure expression t[a,i] t[b,j] H[ic,kb] H[jk,ac] and t[a,i] t[b,j] H[ik,bc] H[jc,ka] are considered equal. See PhD thesis of Anna Engels-Putzka (2009), University of Cologne
